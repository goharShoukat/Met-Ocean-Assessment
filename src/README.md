# Automation - Data Extraction & Plotting
The src directory contains the source codes for the ERA5 library and the individual plotting libraries. These can be accessed and used to develop a routine by the user. If the user intends to extract the data automatically, and plot a default set of figures and tables, then run the Launch_Software.py script. 

## Launching the Software
To execute the CLI based algorithm, fire up Spyder via Anaconda, and execute the script Launch_Software.py from an IPythone Console. 
The ERA5() can either be used by itself or the user can use the sample wrapper provided. This wrapper will interact with the user through the CLI and provide the desired output.
